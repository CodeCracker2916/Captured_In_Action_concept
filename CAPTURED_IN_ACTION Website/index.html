         <p2>As can be shown from a patron user of the website. we were able to help him rediscover his childhood love for Marvel's X-Men
             in the form of MARVEL LEGENDS action figures which were released during late 2024-mid 2025 
             in collaboration with the newly released animated series of X-Men '97.</p2>
